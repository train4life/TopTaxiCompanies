# Project Title: Taxi Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

Overview:
Welcome to the Taxi Analysis and Hypothesis Testing project! In this GitHub repository, you'll find code and resources for analyzing taxi trip data, visualizing key insights, and testing a hypothesis related to trip durations. The project aims to help you identify the top taxi companies, popular drop-off locations, and whether weather impacts trip durations.

Objectives:
This project focuses on achieving the following objectives:

Identifying the top taxi companies based on the number of trips they have provided.
Finding the top 10 drop-off locations based on the average number of trips.
Testing the hypothesis that trip durations are longer on rainy Saturdays when traveling from Loop to O'Hare International airport.

Contents:

data: This directory contains the datasets used for analysis.

project_sql_result_01.csv: Dataset containing information about taxi trips, including trip details, weather conditions, and trip durations.
notebooks: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

TopTaxiCompanies.ipynb: Notebook detailing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps. Notebook containing the analysis and visualization of top taxi companies and drop-off locations. Notebook for testing the hypothesis related to trip durations. This directory contains visual assets generated during the analysis.

README.md: The primary documentation file for the project, providing an overview, objectives, and instructions for replicating the analysis.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the taxi trip dataset.
Handled missing values, data types, and formatting.

Top Taxi Companies and Drop-off Locations:

Identified the top taxi companies based on trip counts.
Found the top 10 drop-off locations based on average trip counts.
Visualized the results using bar charts.

Hypothesis Testing:

Tested the hypothesis that trip durations are longer on rainy Saturdays from Loop to O'Hare International airport.
Calculated relevant statistics and conduct appropriate tests.
Visualized the results using a box plot.

Conclusions:

Summarized the findings from each analysis step.
Provided actionable insights to assist the taxi company in making informed decisions.
